# Codes
This repository contains codes to perform implementation of thesis [AasBirth] on Enron data set.

Our work are implemented with Python 3 language by using Pypbc 0.2 library. We employ SHA-256 as the underlying hash function and curve $y^2=x^3+x$ for Type-A pairings, while parameters are $q$-bits=512 and $r$-bits=160. In addition, an AES-CBC modular is employed to encrypt files whose key is 256 bits and Initialization Vector is 128 bits.
